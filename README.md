# rock_paper_scissors_gui

In this project I will be creating the Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML & JavaScript with a GUI.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) (original).

GUI assignment link can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation).
